According to a recent Verizon Data Breach Investigations Report , 60 percent of cyber - attacks target SMBs , largely because they are easier targets . Related : 4 Reasons You Need Developers With Cybersecurity Skills in All Tech Teams But you do n't have to be passive . Here are five tools and services which small and medium business can use to protect themselves . " In the scramble to secure the cloud , hardware is often overlooked , " says Christoph Schell , president , Americas , HP Inc. " The truth is , if you have 500 employees , it is easier to have one secure cloud structure than it is to secure 500 laptops . Reduce your risk through security - centered device management and proactive practices and policies to engage each employee in the security process . " In addition to creating a secure network , small businesses must select secure hardware and adopt secure protocols to really protect themselves . HP Inc. , has developed security software Touchpoint Manager to help companies streamline their protection policy , minimize security vulnerabilities and monitor protected systems . Marketers , lawyers and sales people are widely using email tracking solutions to improve sales and better engage with prospects and current clients . Those solutions are popular in CRM systems as well . But cybercriminals are also using these tools to track the date and time emails are opened , where they are opened , where they are forwarded and so forth . MailControl allows companies to block spymail from hitting their inbox . It is an especially effective tool in preventing targeted phishing attacks from reaching your business . The most prevalent cyber security risk to small businesses today is ransomware . The FBI estimates that over 4,000 U.S. businesses are infected by ransomware every day . Ransomware takes control of the files on small business networks by encrypting them and holding them for ransom . The existing tools , like anti - virus , are not effective against the rapidly changing variants . WatchPoint has an easy to use tool , called CryptoStopper , which small businesses can download and install to protect their network . CryptoStopper deploys bait files throughout a network . When these bait files are encrypted , the infected user is isolated , and the ransomware is stopped before doing damage . This is a new and unique approach to stopping ransomware . Related : 6 Reasons Smart Small Business Owners Invest In Security One of the most common , and preventable , attacks on small businesses is a social - engineering attack triggered by phishing attempts , improper web use or incoming phone calls . The most current training systems on the market are designed for large enterprises , but some companies set up our solution to help any size business , from those with just a few employees to those with thousands . Security Awareness Training -- Security Mentor : Employees are n't always ready to combat a cyberattack or know when they are being baited into one . Security Mentor has created 10-minute lessons with its Security Awareness Training program . Small businesses will be able to train employees to be aware and alert , while making the right choices in a potential cyber crisis through these brief , online lessons . Traditionally , companies have used SSL / TLS certificates ( displayed as " https " ) only on shopping carts or login pages . This can help , as it encrypts the data being sent between the customer 's computer and the SMB 's web server . Also , if companies use an Extended Validation ( EV ) certificate , the web browser will display a green padlock and website - address bar , as well as the company 's name next to the website address . Today , though , companies are encouraged to follow what 's known as Always on SSL . This means that the entire website is protected by https , instead of just a couple of pages . This helps protect against modern attacks that seek to steal information when a site visitor browses between secure and not - secure pages . Finally , Dan Hubbard , product CTO of Cloud Security , Cisco Systems , shared some advice . " There are a few things small businesses can do , " he said . First , make sure you have security solutions in place that are proven to detect and stop the majority of malware -- and make sure they are deployed at critical points within the company . " Second , in terms of ransomware : Back up your data . If you have a copy of your information that the attackers ca n't get to , you are not at their mercy .

Every year , new edtech companies bring innovative products to the table -- from online certification platforms to websites that offer interactive learning apps . We 've seen a lot of well - established eLearning websites that do their part in nurturing the next generation . But this did n't stop innovators from introducing features that set the tone for the future of the edtech industry . Here are four of the most promising edtech startups that could become the key players : Working out of their dorm rooms as college freshman , Studypool founders Richard Werbe and Jimmy Zhong ironically skipped weeks of classes to reinvent how students learn through a concept called " Microtutoring . " CEO Richard Werbe explains , " Microtutoring breaks down conventional tutoring into smaller , more digestible pieces of learning . By eliminating the barrier of set - time tutoring sessions , students can master subjects more efficiently on a time interval tailored to their needs . Typical sessions last one to 10 minutes but can take up to several hours depending on the student . " Werbe emphasizes that learning is all about mastery , and Studypool 's mission is to make mastering a particular subject matter easier for students . He continues , " Think about when you were stuck on that tricky algebra question in high school and you called your smart friend for help . That was microtutoring ! Studypool is doing that times ten million . It 's like having thousands of friends that are professional tutors that can help 24/7 , on demand . By using today 's online technology , Studypool has created the infrastructure needed to support Microtutoring . " Related : Top 5 Freelancing Jobs That Are Best Suited For Women Studypool 's aggressive approach has made a splash on the Internet since its launch in 2014 as students discovered the appeal of Microtutoring . One early customer Daniel Zhang gave the website a glowing review : " I got help with a kinematic physics equation lying in bed in my dorm room at two in the morning ! " Within a month of its launch , Studypool had thousands of users . Today the company has raised $ 2.3 million in seed funding , has helped over a million students , and offers services from over 40,000 verified tutors . Werbe reports that the platform is growing faster than ever and is seeing significant revenues . Other than reading books and gaining experience , accepting feedback is one of the best ways to learn . True , evaluating a student 's performance and providing assessments are normally for teachers . But with Peergrade , students can evaluate and grade each other 's work through peer assessment sessions . Launched in 2015 by co - founders David Kofoed Wind , Malthe Jorgensen , and Simon Lind , Peergrade 's original goal was to help teachers keep up with a growing number of students while still providing the close attention and fair evaluation they deserve . " Continuous budget limitations for educational institutions force teachers to teach larger classes and consequently cut back on the number of written assignments or grade more homework , " says David . " Letting students partake in the process of evaluating and giving feedback enables them to learn from the work of others . " The platform works by allowing teachers to create online assignments and specify the criteria for evaluation . As students hand in their work , it goes through other students for peer - assessment first . Once all feedback is given , the teacher can get a full overview of the session . Last year , Peergrade received a total of $ 300,000 in seed funding . It is now being used in major universities across Denmark and neighboring countries . Interested organizations can also use their service for free through their website . It 's no secret that a lot of students find history as one of the most boring subjects . Perhaps it 's due to the heavy reliance on thick textbooks and bland teaching methods available in the school system . Time Machine Tours -- an iOS app founded by Kyle Hudson in 2015 -- is set to forever change the way history is learned . Utilizing GPS technology , users can tell the exact location of photographers when they took historical photos . " History lessons are presented to them in big blocks of text and their eyes glaze over . Time Machine Tours lets kids access and experience history in a way they 've never been able to before , " says Hudson . The app offers tours that utilize augmented reality , with which users can hold their phones over the actual locations . This creates the illusion that makes users feel as if they 're staring into the past . Like it or not , it is a much more engaging way to learn history than reading in a classroom or library . Currently , Time Machine Tours is only available in selection locations -- namely New York , Chicago , Philadelphia , and Washington DC . New content is being added monthly with new locations , but for now , there 's no announcement of a major expansion or funding . Related : Lessons for the New CEO From 5 Great Leaders of History ClassTag is a different kind of startup that focuses not on the students , but on the parent - teacher relationship . Everyone should be aware that it is both the parent and teacher 's job to foster learning minds . That 's why schools hold parent - teacher conferences that allow collaboration and create a better learning environment for students -- at home and in the classroom . Related : How Social Media is Reshaping Today 's Education System Founded by Vlada Lotkina in 2015 , a Wharton MBA and former Fortune 500 executive , ClassTag 's main objective is to provide a classroom community . This utilizes the collective effort of teachers and parents in tending to the needs of the students . With the platform , teachers can organize events , schedule conferences , and launch newsletter campaigns to maintain open communication . " ClassTag 's mission is to help teachers engage parents in the classroom by handling the busy work , " says Lotkina . " Our service is carefully crafted to simplify logistics and communications issues in classrooms . " Currently , ClassTag is being used by leading private and public schools . According to Lotkina , the platform borrows from corporations the concept of getting employees involved in programs that match their interests , particularly in charity and volunteering events . Since parents highly value their children 's education , they are guaranteed to participate in opportunities provided by platforms like ClassTag .

( BigStock Image ) With 2016 now in the rear - view mirror , it 's time to take a quick moment to forecast what might be looming on the horizon in the near year . Who better to ask than a group of venture capitalists , the money managers who are paid big bucks to see around corners and determine what technologies will impact our lives going forward . The new year certainly brings a set of challenges and opportunities , and this much is clear : No one really knows what will happen . As venture capitalist Loretta Little says : " what a year 2017 will be to predict anything ! " Even so , we quizzed five Seattle area venture capitalists to get their take on what they think will transpire in 2017 . Optimistic by their nature , all of the venture capitalists believe the Nasdaq will continue to surge , with one predicting a 25 percent uptick . They also see a steady stream of initial public offerings . In terms of hot sectors , they are bullish about cloud computing , artificial intelligence and personalized genomics , while many think the technologies behind autonomous vehicles are a bit overhyped . Here 's more from our five VCs : Number of IPOs in Washington state in 2017 ( candidates ) : Three ( Avalara , Avvo and a biotech whose name I do n't know ) . What will be the most overhyped technology of 2017 : Machine learning / machine intelligence - not because its unimportant but because it ( has ) become basic tablestakes . What business area are you most excited to spend time on in 2017 : I continue to believe we are very early on in the full transition of the enterprise to the cloud . Also , opportunities related to globalization ( next billion coming online and entering the world economy ) , retraining and re - skilling initiatives aimed at those being displaced by automation , and the impact of renewable energy now being cheaper than fossil fuels . Advice to startups for 2017 : We 've had a remarkably forgiving five to seven year run where so many ideas seemed to work , at least for a time . The next five years will require more fortitude , a focus on ' hard tech ' and solving deeply rooted societal problems . Other bold predictions for 2017 in tech , politics , sports or anything else : Facebook will find a way to buy , or bury , Snapchat . Microsoft will buy either SAP or Salesforce to consolidate its position in the enterprise . Bezos will purchase Twitter and consolidate it with the Washington Post . This will be an up or out year for VR / AR where it will start to generate a market and live up to early expectations - or not . The Bay Area will see a marked ( 10%+ ) decline in startup activity relative to locations like Seattle , Portland , Austin , Boulder and LA due to the cost of real estate and housing - startups and their employees will be priced out of the geography . The NBA will announce a return to Seattle . Number of IPOs in Washington state in 2017 : 2 Number of new investments your firm plans to make in 2017 : 10 - 14 , consistent with our pace of the last several years . We continue to see many compelling opportunities and exciting new Pacific Northwest companies being formed , and so we plan to continue an aggressive investment pace . Google 's stock close on 12/31/17 ( $ 771.82 now ) : $ 875 Microsoft 's stock close on 12/31/17 ( $ 62.14 now ) : $ 67.50 Amazon 's stock close on 12/31/17 ( $ 748.87 now ) : $ 914 Apple stock close on 12/31/17 : ( $ 115.82 now ) : $ 115 Nasdaq final close on 12/31/17 ( 5,383 now ) : 5,825 What will be the hottest technology of 2017 : AI and machine learning will continue to be the hottest and most important technological wave , infusing most / all sectors of technology , as all applications become " intelligent applications " over time . What will be the most overhyped technology of 2017 : Autonomous Cars . I think we are moving down the path towards truly autonomous self - driving cars faster than most anticipated just a few years ago , and we will definitely get there . We will see continued incremental innovation and capabilities demonstrated in 2017 . However , we will also see players run into the reality of the many challenges around this technology . I and Madrona are long - term very bullish in this field , but the hype feels like it 's at a fever pitch versus what the industry can actually deliver this coming year . What business area are you most excited to spend time on in 2017 : I am extremely excited about enterprises continued move to cloud native computing , updating their architectures to a combination of cloud , containers and microservices . Within this , I think you will see the popularity of Kubernetes continue to increase ( one of our drivers behind investing in Heptio ) . Advice to startups for 2017 : Be scrappy with cash , maniacally focus on your customers and prospects , raise money on reasonable terms when you have the opportunity to do so , be very detail - oriented measuring and understanding your unit economics , and then be aggressive scaling when you see favorable and repeatable unit economics for acquiring and retaining customers . Other bold predictions for 2017 in tech , politics , sports or anything else : Private company M&A will increase . Mariners will make the World Series . Number of IPOs in Washington state in 2017 : 2 - 3 ? Still probably low because there is a lot of private equity out there for solid companies . Perhaps Redfin and Adaptive Biotechnologies . Number of new investments your firm plans to make in 2017 : Our investments are based on a fiscal year ( July to June ) . We have made two new investments since July 2016 . I expect , in calendar year 2017 , we will make 2 - 4 more . Google 's stock close on 12/31/17 ( $ 771.82 now ) : $ 850 Microsoft 's stock close on 12/31/17 ( $ 62.14 now ) : $ 70 Amazon 's stock close on 12/31/17 ( $ 749.87 now ) : $ 850 Apple stock close on 12/31/17 ( $ 115.82 now ) : $ 130 Nasdaq final close on 12/31/17 ( 5,383 now ) : Who would have predicted the market increases amid all the uncertainty ? Will that change ? 5,600 . What will be the hottest technology of 2017 : Tech : virtual assistants & natural language processing . Biotech : CRISPR / Cas gene editing system What will be the most overhyped technology of 2017 : Tech - autonomous vehicles ; Bio - I 'm not going to pick a specific technology . What makes me crazy in the life sciences arena is when scientists publish a paper or report data at a conference and it gets hyped by others so members of the general public believe there is an actual product . This leads to unrealistic expectations and sometimes a distrust of science . What business area are you most excited to spend time on in 2017 : No specific area . I invest in early stage companies , so I am generally an optimist and try to track across the healthcare spectrum . Advice to startups for 2017 : Be able to concisely describe your business , your value proposition and your goals . Stay flexible and continually revisit your assumptions . Ask for input from a myriad of sources . You do n't need to agree , but you should always be listening . Other bold predictions for 2017 in tech , politics , sports or anything else : These are n't bold -- I think they are pretty realistic -- more vegetables , more VR , Viaduct vagaries and vocal voters . * Loretta wanted to offer this caveat : " My focus is on life science / healthcare companies so my predictions on tech companies are based on general observation versus in depth industry knowledge . I noticed you did n't ask about Seattle Genetics , Amgen or Cerner . " Number of IPOs in Washington state in 2017 ( candidates ) : Two : Avalara , Payscale or Offerup Number of new investments your firm plans to make in 2017 : 4 Google 's stock close on 12/31/17 ( $ 771.82 now ) : $ 825 Microsoft 's stock close on 12/31/17 ( $ 62.14 now ) : $ 74 Amazon 's stock close on 12/31/17 ( $ 749.87 now ) : $ 942 Apple stock close on 12/31/17 ( $ 115.82 now ) : $ 126 Nasdaq final close on 12/31/17 ( 5,383 now ) : 5,680 What will be the hottest technology of 2017 : Smart home applications ; Text and chatbots emerge as a new channel for businesses to interact with customers What will be the most overhyped technology of 2017 : Self - driving cars ; also VR ( virtual reality ) as widespread adoption ( once again ) will be slow . What business area are you most excited to spend time on in 2017 : Advanced analytics , AI and machine learning applications that optimize business processes and/or customer interactions ; Advice to startups for 2017 : Go solve real customer problems , not a perceived market opportunity ; once you have a customer , make them happy and find ways to offer them more . If you have to raise capital , do it early in 2017 before the cost and availability of capital is more constrained . And do n't judge success by how much money you have raised , the most effective form of funding is revenue from satisfied customers and partners . Other bold predictions for 2017 in tech , politics , sports or anything else : -Venture funding will get tighter and valuations will moderate ; several unicorns will have financial issues buy the end of the year -Interest rates will rise by 200 basis points and appreciation in the housing market will slow . -F5 and Twitter get acquired . -Rise of populism continues in Europe , threatening the EU . -Seattle will settle on an arena option for basketball / hockey , with Chris Hansen leading the way to a deal . -Seattle Rep musical , Come From Away , is a smash hit on Broadway . -Seattle continues to thrive as a major U.S. tech hub Number of IPOs in Washington state in 2017 : 4 Number of new investments your firm plans to make in 2017 : Another record year for Lighter Capital . We will double our deals again and do 200 in 2017 . What will be the most overhyped technology of 2017 : Virtual reality . I think we are going to find out who the winners and losers are in the VR space in 2017 , with a lot of VR companies running out of steam / money . What business area are you most excited to spend time on in 2017 : Continued use of big data to help reduce our cost of capital to our customers Advice to startups for 2017 : Have a plan for getting to break even ( you do n't have to be on it but at least know how you would execute it ) Other bold predictions for 2017 in tech , politics , sports or anything else : Patriots win the Super Bowl ( again ) !
Telstra has appointed Julie Trell as the new head of its accelerator program muru - D , following the departure of cofounder and former chief Annie Parker to new Sydney startup hub Lighthouse . Most recently the founder of Playful Purpose , Trell has worked in a variety of roles , including a long stint at Salesforce .

Brolly may have only graduated from incubator Entrepreneur First in September , but this startup already has ambitious plans to give customers a single place to view , manage and buy insurance from their mobile . To really shake up an industry rife with inertia and outdated products Phoebe Hugh , cofounder and CEO at Brolly , aims to go back to the days where your insurance broker knew what you needed and helped you to manage an insurance portfolio , before the days of price comparison sites and online portals . Instead of connecting you with a human broker though , Brolly uses artificial intelligence ( AI ) and machine learning . Hugh , a psychology graduate from the University of Manchester , left her job at insurance giant Aviva in March 2015 and enrolled in the prestigious Entrepreneur First programme , joining the sixth cohort a year later in March 2016 . There she met her cofounder , CTO Mykhailo Loginov . She had become jaded by an industry that only ever seemed to " unlock a whole host of frustrations " in customers , and which had not yet produced a successful new consumer brand or startup focusing on doing things differently . Hugh explained that before the internet all insurance was managed by brokers " who would manage everything " . " The products haven't changed . So people end up not getting advice anymore , they are trying to figure stuff out and end up under insured or buy stuff they do n't need . " In short : management of insurance policies has become fatally fragmented , " so there is no portfolio visually . Everything comes through your email or paper or an online portal , there is no join up , " she told Techworld . " The biggest issue that results from that is inertia , so you end up leaving things and you end up paying double , because you are n't rewarded for loyalty , you are reprimanded . This is characteristic of how the market is today and what we wanted to do at Brolly was cut through that . " The first step was getting an app off the ground . This soon became three interlocking products , all housed in the Brolly app . In Hugh 's words : " The app originally was designed to focus on the biggest issues consumers were facing , and we grouped them into : understanding insurance , managing insurance and buying insurance . " These became the Brolly Advisor , Locker and Shop . With the advisor Hugh wanted " to create an advisor which based on what you put in you get valuable output to help you understand where you might have gaps in cover " . In practice you provide the app with information such as lifestyle and financial attributes , and then give the app access to your inbox so that it can scrape your existing policy documents into the locker . Now the algorithm takes over and " spots where you have gaps , like income protection insurance , explains what it is and asks would you like to get a quote ? " The locker is " the hub , it 's where customers manage everything they have and anything they buy goes in there and anything that is n't they can be advised on " . In the locker customers can access documents , contact providers , see how much they are paying and upcoming renewal dates . Any gaps can be advised upon and then , once it comes online later this year , products can be bought in the shop . The last piece of the puzzle is the shop , which Hugh says is the most demanded feature . It is currently being tested with beta customers and is set to become available to the public in the summer . Brolly will start by offering home , motor and travel , with more product lines to come . Hugh wants the shop to be " extremely fast and fully self service , so a couple of taps to get your policy . It is about convenience , there is not a huge focus on getting the cheapest policy , it is more customers that value quality products and want a fast way to buy something outright " . The shop will also learn more about you and even " if they do n't need a quote today it gives us the ability to look around in the background to push notifications to the user to suggest the best time to switch , so it is trying to be that proactive advisor in someone 's pocket , " Hugh summarised . Brolly will take a commission on any products it sells through the app and the insurance providers in exchange get access to high quality customers , according to Hugh . " Due to the relationship we are building with our customers we really have a deep understanding of their lives , we know this homeowner has two cars and children and likes to travel and it is delivering an entire holistic person and insurers see tremendous value in being able to tap into good quality risk and stripping out fraud , " she said . This personal profile is n't handed over to the insurer but is anonymised . Hugh explained : " Pricing today is focused on product lines not the individual , and it is using actuarial models rather than holistic pictures of people . " So an actuarial model for the entire customer base whereas we use machine learning techniques to get right down to personalised risk models . That is where the value of our data lies . " She added the Brolly platform is poised to incorporate data from wearable devices and car telematics in the future too . Insurtech is set for a bumper year , with KPMG already predicting that 2017 is the year the nascent industry will " come into its own " . If Brolly is going to take advantage of this it will need to get the shop up and running and ramp up customer acquisition . Hugh is already looking at the ways UK challenger banks have taken a transparent , community - first approach to get early adopters on board . Brolly will almost certainly have to contend with a raft of imitators soon enough . To date Hugh believes that most startups have focused on smaller pieces of the puzzle than an all - in - one solution . The question will be if Brolly has bitten off more than it can chew .

Julie Sandler accepts the award for Geek of the Year at the 2014 GeekWire Awards . She is now moving from Madrona to Pioneer Square Labs . ( GeekWire Photo ) For the past five years , Julie Sandler has immersed herself in the startup world as an investor , advisor , and mentor , traveling around the country and meeting entrepreneurs at accelerators , incubators , makerspaces , and more . But she hasn't seen anything that helps entrepreneurs succeed quite like Pioneer Square Labs ( PSL ) -- and now Sandler is leaving Madrona Venture Group to join the Seattle - based startup studio . Sandler this week became a managing director at PSL , an 18-month old " startup studio " that uses a unique innovation model to rapidly test and validate new ideas before recruiting an executive team to build out a spin - off company . She is PSL 's fourth managing director , joining co - founders Greg Gottesman , Geoff Entress and Mike Galgon . Sandler previously spent six years at Madrona , one of the top venture capital firms in the Pacific Northwest , and worked her way up to become a partner at the firm this past January . In an email to friends , Sandler called it a " difficult decision " to leave Madrona , noting that she had an " amazing experience there with a wonderful team . " But the Seattle venture capitalist said she was intrigued by Pioneer Square Labs . She 's kept a close eye on the firm from the time it launched in October 2015 , particularly given that Madrona was an early investor in the studio , and Gottesman , who served as managing director at Madrona for 18 years , started PSL . His fellow co - founders -- Entress and Ben Gilbert -- also spent time at Madrona before starting PSL . At the same time , Sandler developed a passion for helping people who were in the early stages of company building . She noticed the quality of entrepreneurs who were coming through PSL , as well as its growing entrepreneur - in - residence program . " It 's one of the most vibrant innovation environments that I 've seen , anywhere , " Sandler told GeekWire . " There is nothing I 've seen that is as high - leverage or more entrepreneur - centric than what 's happening at PSL . " Sandler was already helping entrepreneurs while working at Madrona , which also runs a similar " startup studio " called Madrona Venture Labs . But the opportunity to join PSL in its nascent stage -- she calls it a startup -- was enough to convince the Harvard and Stanford grad to make the change . " This organization is clearly on a roll , " she explained . " It 's also early enough for me to really take on the role of an early team member and help develop how this model evolves to serve the entrepreneurs in our region in numerous ways . " Gottesman said Sandler is uniquely suited to help PSL build the " best platform in the world for entrepreneurs . " " In addition to being an incredibly smart , creative and inspirational leader , Julie is one of the most capable and entrepreneur - centric investors I have met in my 20 years of venture capital , " he added . Sandler , who helped lead investments in startups like Integris , Poppy and Julep , said she had an " amazing ride at Madrona " and looks forward to continuing to work with the VC firm . She said " the relationship is close . " Asked about that relationship given Sandler 's transition , Gottesman noted how Madrona is an investor in PSL and also invested in some of the studio 's spinout companies . " We are excited to continue to find ways to work together to help build the Seattle ecosystem , " he said . In a statement to GeekWire , Madrona Managing Director Scott Jacobson echoed those thoughts . " Julie has been a great contributor to Madrona , many of our portfolio companies , and in the Seattle startup ecosystem , " he said . " We are excited for her in her new role at PSL and look forward to working together in the future to help build early stage companies in our region . " Sandler , GeekWire 's 2014 Geek of the Year and a 2016 Presidential Leadership Scholar , is also passionate about helping women and underrepresented entrepreneurs ; she helped start the Seattle Entrepreneurial Women 's Network , for example . Sandler said it will be an area of importance for her at PSL and she hopes to bring a diverse mix of entrepreneurs to the studio . " There is an entirely new generation of founders coming up here in the Pacific Northwest , and especially Seattle , that is far more diverse across multiple dimensions than any generation of the past , " she said , adding that she 's never been more bullish about Seattle - based entrepreneurship . PSL employs 17 people and five entrepreneurs - in - residence . It has spun out six companies , with four publicly announced :
Dino Vendetti , General Partner at Seven Peaks Ventures . Seven Peaks Ventures plans to raise $ 30 million for its second fund and will invest in 20-to-25 startups across the West Coast . The Bend , Ore .- based venture firm has already raised $ 15 million of the fund and will focus on the Pacific Northwest . It 's a big jump from Seven Peaks ' first fund , which totaled $ 7.4 million and helped back 20 companies like Portland - based Opal , Bend - based Manzama , Seattle - based Amplero , and several others in places like Utah and Boulder . Seven Peaks , founded in 2013 , will continue looking for software companies poised to become category leaders in their market space , said Dino Vendetti , general partner at Seven Peaks . " What we learned in Fund I is that there is a growing number of high quality startups and entrepreneurs who are building businesses in places like Seattle and Portland , and these entrepreneurs need the support and help from experienced investors with company - building backgrounds to help them navigate their journey in scaling their startups , " Vendetti told GeekWire . Vendetti said that in markets like Seattle and Portland , there is a " distinct shortage " in investment between seed round angel investors and larger venture capital funds . Seven Peaks aims to fill the gap in between . " That 's the hole in the market that we intend to help fill in a thoughtful , focused , manner , " said Vendetti , who is also bullish on Bend 's future as a startup hub . In addition to Vendetti , the Seven Peaks investment partners are Tom Gonser , the DocuSign co - founder who joined this past November ; Matt Abrams , a former leader at Hyperion and Oracle ; and Corey Schmid , formerly with director at Philips HealthCare . Vendetti , a former partner at Bay Partners in Silicon Valley and Vulcan Ventures in Seattle , said the firm is looking to bring on a venture partner based in Seattle . Seven Peaks also helps run a number of events , including Bend Bonfire , Cyber Security Summit , Machine Learning Summit , and the Bend Venture Conference , which awarded more than $ 4 million in investment to startups last year .
Kushal Chakrabarti and Ajit Banerjee , co - founders of TalentWorks . Photos via TalentWorks . It can be difficult to find a job that matches your interests and qualifications , particularly just after graduating from college or university . Now a new startup , led by former Amazon engineering leader and Vittana founder Kushal Chakrabarti , wants to make that process easier with an end - to - end AI - fueled platform that helps job applicants land interviews . TalentWorks came out of stealth mode on Tuesday and announced $ 2.4 million in funding from Lowercase Capital ( Uber , Instagram backer ) , Founder 's Co - op ( Tune , Urban Airship backer ) , Felicis Ventures ( Fitbit , Meraki backer ) , and angels investors like Rick Dalzell , Steve Arnold and Sebastien de Halleux . TalentWorks charges users $ 10 per week and in exchange guarantees job interviews based on a person 's interest and qualifications . The startup offers a three - pronged service that includes a resume optimizer , an application scourer , and a human hiring manager to help you through the process of finding the right job . In a single day , the software can scan 50,000-plus jobs in more than 400 cities ; it also can match a resume against 100,000 others . " No one else offers the end - to - end promise that we provide for job - seekers , " Chakrabarti told GeekWire . " If you use TalentWorks , we 'll make sure you get an interview . " Thus far , the company has found traction combining the data - driven matching technology with a human touch . It has optimized nearly 57,000 resumes and analyzed more than 24 million jobs . In May , 71 percent of recent college graduates using TalentWorks landed an interview in two weeks . If a user does not land an interview after 60 days , their subscription fees will be refunded . " Over the past year and a half , we 've studied what gets people jobs -- what works and does n't work in the real world , " Chakrabarti said . " I 'm confident that our 1:1 mentoring and our sophisticated job - matching and resume optimization algorithms work . I 'm confident that no one else can match the real - world experience we 've accumulated in helping people ultimately land a job . " The service also aims to help traditionally underrepresented groups or those that may not have robust social networks by instead relying more heavily on machine learning and AI to create matches . " We 've built sophisticated AI algorithms to surface the things that really matter to people but are often hidden behind complex , corporate HR - speak ; fair salary , required qualifications , competition , to name a few , " Chakrabarti noted . Chakrabarti said the $ 10 per week charge is an appropriate balance for what people can afford and how much support they offer . He said it 's important to note that the company 's customers are the job seekers themselves . " This is one of the most important tenets within TalentWorks -- it means we solve the problems that are most important to job - seekers , " the CEO added . Finding a job is a real issue for millions of people in America and there are several companies using technology to come up with a solution , from LinkedIn to Indeed . Even Google last month announced a new initiative that aims to match available jobs with potential candidates . Chakrabarti started the company two years ago with co - founder Ajit Banerjee , a former principal engineer at Amazon and Facebook . Before that , Chakrabarti launched Vittana in 2007 . The non - profit , backed by people like venture capitalist Vinod Khosla and Zillow co - founder Rich Barton , helped more than 25,000 students in 17 countries get loans for education . It shut down in 2014 ; Chakrabarti had stepped down a year earlier and traveled the world . Chakrabarti said TalentWorks is the manifestation of his experience leading Vittana and the three years he spent at Amazon as an engineering leader . It combines " Amazon 's desire to connect you with everything and Vittana 's mission to help people get the opportunities they deserve , " he noted . Chakrabarti also has a personal connection to the company 's ethos . He grew up in a rough Los Angeles neighborhood and credits his success to having people in his corner for support . " Today , nearly half of all 20-somethings are under - employed , " he writes on TalentWorks ' site . " People do n't even get a ( real , honest ) chance anymore . That 's not something I can live with . This is personal . And that 's why I 've made it my mission to help people get the opportunities they deserve . " TalentWorks employs 13 people , with 40 percent of the workforce based in San Francisco .
Tango Card 's " rewards as a service " API . ( Tango Card Photo ) Seattle startup Tango Card has raised $ 10 million to speed up the expansion of its digital rewards platform . Previous investor Western Technology Investment is responsible for 100 percent of this round of funding , which is coming in the form of debt rather than equity . Tango Card CEO David Leeds said the company is on a clear path to profitability , and he did n't want to give up any additional equity . This latest round brings Tango Card to approximately $ 19.5 million raised since its 2010 founding . The company plans to use the money to pursue international expansion and speed up the launch of new products . Tango Card aims to make it easier for companies to provide digital rewards , whether it be a gift card to a well performing employee , an incentive for signing up for a service or a nonprofit donation in a partner 's name . Businesses spend billions annually around the world on these types of rewards , but Leeds said the system is in need of change . " There are 2 million companies globally that use rewards and incentives , and a million of them are do - it - yourselfers , " Leeds said . " Picture a head of HR in a company of about 100 people ; if they have a reward or recognition program , they may literally have a drawer full of gift cards they give out on a daily , weekly , monthly basis . " Tango Card partners with more than 2,000 companies big and small , global and local . At Microsoft , Tango Card helps power the rewards platform in which customers earn points that they can redeem for products and causes . Remitly , a Seattle startup that lets people send money to family members abroad , uses rewards to encourage people to make their first international transfer . Tango Card 's headcount has tripled in size over the last three years . It has 70 people working out of its headquarters in the West Seattle neighborhood , and another eight people at an engineering center in Boise . Leeds said Tango Card plans to hire another 10 people this year . The idea for the company came to Leeds as he was looking into the concept of payments over wireless networks . He found that gift cards were the fastest growing type of payments for both consumers and enterprises . The company has pivoted a few times since it launched . Initially , the company started with its own gift card offering but later moved away from it . Tango Card categorizes its offering as a " rewards as a service " platform . The company just recently launched 2.0 versions of its rewards delivery platform and an API that helps businesses manage digital rewards . Later this year , Tango Card plans to launch its first self - service products with more of a web - based interface . Managing digital rewards can be a tough business , as it requires a large inventory of incentives , including everything from Amazon gift cards , to digital rewards in places like China to nonprofit donations . " In some cases , companies will start with sending a single gift card , " Leeds said . " What they find is that their customers are typically saying ' that 's great but we want a choice or a selection . ' So ultimately providing that selection can be very complicated and that 's when companies typically work with us , when they have a reward or incentive program that needs some more management . "
The sports media landscape seems to be changing everyday , but some investors like the potential they see in HERO Sports . The Seattle - area startup just reeled in a $ 1.3 million investment round led by PN Cellular Inc. and Alliance of Angels . HERO Sports originally launched in 2014 as BennettRank , which ranked college sports teams across the U.S. The company later rebranded as HERO Sports and expanded beyond just numbers ; today it provides more holistic online coverage of more than 20,000 NCAA teams . The site has a similar feel to sports media giant Bleacher Report -- Bleacher Report CEO Dave Finocchio just spoke at the GeekWire Sports Tech Summit -- but with a focus on college sports ranging from top Division-1 teams to lower - level programs . Hero Sports also produces some NBA and NFL - related content . Here 's a description from the company 's LinkedIn page : Our mission is to advance interest and appreciation for small - school athletics through aggregating and publicizing stories about teams , players , fans , and coaches . We view ourselves as empowering partners of athletic departments . We work with sports information teams , and media teams , to develop stories and bring attention to program , team , and individual achievements . We strive to create an online platform capable of capturing and promoting every newsworthy story in collegiate athletics across the country . HERO Sports co - founder and former college baseball player Jordan Nilsen told GeekWire that the funding will be used to scale content production and " further evangelize the accomplishments and contributions of under - served athletes , coaches , fans , students , and educational institutions . " The company will also invest more money in its proprietary ranking and prediction algorithms , while growing its partnership program that lets brands reach college sports fans . Total funding to date for HERO Sports is $ 3.7 million . The company employs 10 people .
Auth0 CEO Jon Gelsey ( Auth0 Photo ) Identity is the bedrock of so many internet services , both personal and professional . Secure , easy - to - use identity management systems are in high demand by consumer - facing companies that also need to manage their own employee application logins , and Auth0 is ready to go after more of those organizations with new funding . The Bellevue - based startup just raised $ 30 million in a Series C round led by Meritech Capital Partners , with participation from Auth0 's existing investors as well as the venture arms of two Asian telecoms : Japan 's NTT DoCoMo and Australia 's Telstra . Auth0 has now raised $ 53 million in funding to help develop its system for managing logins to both consumer applications and internal corporate systems . " The internet is a very dangerous place ; our job is making it easier for IT admins to make their apps secure by design , " said Jon Gelsey , CEO of Auth0 . There are a lot of companies that offer help in managing one of the most crucial questions for application developers : are the right people using this app ? Okta is perhaps the darling of the space right now , executing its IPO this past April , but Microsoft ( where Gelsey once worked ) and Ping Identity are also players in this space along with a score of startups like Auth0 . Gelsey acknowledged the competition , but pointed out that one of his company 's biggest competitors are internal IT organizations that think they can build and manage sign - on technology on their own . " More and more modern enterprises are recognizing that every line of code that 's not part of our core product is not an asset . The less code one writes by replacing your code with a call to Auth0 , the more secure your application or IoT device is going to be , " he said . Auth0 has been seeing more success outside the U.S. ; more than half its revenue comes from customers in foreign countries , Gelsey said . It counts Australia - based Atlassian among its larger customers , but it also provides its services to prominent U.S. companies like News Corp. and Nvidia . The company now has 225 employees , and while its headquarters remain in Bellevue , Auth0 is a truly global operation . A " minority " of employees are based in Washington , while the company just opened an office in London and is preparing to open one in Sydney , Australia , joining an existing office in Buenos Aires , Gelsey said . However , Auth0 will always be a Seattle - area company at heart . It made last year 's Seattle 10 , GeekWire 's list of the most promising startups in the area .
Photo via Bigstock . MetaBrite continues to see more demand for its technology platform and just raised more cash to help support the company 's growth . The Seattle - based startup reeled in another $ 2.2 million to close out a $ 13.2 million Series A round , bringing total funding to more than $ 18 million for the 4-year - old company . MetaBrite has developed machine learning technology that can scan consumer purchase receipts and automatically extract precise item - level details from any retailer . It licenses its receipt processing SDK into multiple consumer - facing apps . MetaBrite CEO Court Lorenzini originally raised nearly $ 5 million for CookBrite , which was the name of his company that built a one - stop mobile meal - planning solution , acting as a digital shopping list and recipe book . But in November 2015 , the startup changed its name to MetaBrite . It shut down CookBrite and focused on building a business intelligence platform . Now the company employs 40 people and its business is " expanding at an extraordinary rate , " Lorenzini told GeekWire . Revenue is " at least doubling every month , " he added . " We 're now raising our Series B at a higher valuation to keep up with accelerating demand for our services , " noted Lorenzini , who previously co - founded Docusign . Other MetaBrite executives include CTO Roy Penn , a former engineer with the Israeli Defense Forces , and CPO Christine McKee , a former RealNetworks and Expedia executive . Other employees have experience at places like Kraft , McDonalds , IBM , and Nielsen .

Shortly after this year 's EU - Startups Conference in Berlin , I spent a month living and working in Barcelona . Although I 've been there several times before , this time I happened to fall in love with the city and with the Barcelona startup scene . Currently based in Munich , I was thinking about relocating the whole EU - Startups project to another city for quite some time . In May , I did a little Twitter poll to see what you ( our readers / followers ) are thinking , and most of you voted for Barcelona and Berlin as best places for our potential relocation . At that point I was still far from making a decision , but in the meantime I decided to rebrand our annual event from " EU - Startups Conference " to " EU - Startups Summit " . The new logo , which we got from hosting a 99designs contest , can be viewed in the Barcelona picture above this article . In the middle of June , I then did another Twitter poll to see which location might be a good fit for the EU - Startups Summit 2018 . A bit surprisingly , Valencia turned out to be the first choice of the people taking part in our Twitter poll ( see below ) . Big respect for the Valencian startup community that obviously campaigned for the poll , which saw 554 votes within just 24 hours . We really considered Valencia and talked to quite a few potential partners and ecosystem players to see whether it makes sense and if we can make it happen . But in the end , Barcelona , which ranked number 2 in our little Twitter poll , was the easier decision - since I already have quite a few personal and professional contacts there , the startup ecosystem is bigger , the city a bit more international ( etc . ) . I hope the Valencian startup community will forgive me and it would be great to meet some of you in person at the EU - Startups Summit 2018 ! Long story short : I will personally relocate to Barcelona on July 12 and the EU - Startups Summit 2018 will be held there on April 13 . It will be the 5th edition of our annual flagship event - and with 750 + attendees also our biggest one ! After 1 year of hosting it in Munich and 3 years of doing it in Berlin , we 're now super excited about the relocation to Barcelona . The relocation is a big step for EU - Startups but also for me personally . Since starting the blog in October 2010 as a hobby project , EU - Startups became one of the leading startup publications in Europe and today reaches more than 70,000 founders , startup enthusiasts and investors from all across Europe ( about 165,000 monthly page views ) . I 'm looking forward to further grow this little media and events business in Barcelona . In the end , EU - Startups is not a German project , or a Spanish one , but a truly European platform that aims to connect and inspire entrepreneurs from all across the continent . The move to Barcelona might also help us to further facilitate this European spirit ! That being said , it would be awesome to meet as many of you as possible at the 2018 edition of the EU - Startups Summit on April 13 in Barcelona . As in the previous years , we 'll showcase a selection of Europe 's hottest startups ( incl . a big pitch competition ) and come together to learn from some of the most successful European entrepreneurs of our time . You can expect exciting speakers , a large number of high profile investors , great networking opportunities and many more . The exact venue , speakers line - up , agenda , etc . will be announced step by step over the coming weeks / months . If you already want to secure your ticket , you can do that now !

Qonto , a French fintech startup that provides online banking services for startups , has raised EUR10 million additional funding from its two main investors , Valar Ventures and Alven Capital . In the beginning of this year Qonto already raised EUR1.6 million in seed funding from Valar Ventures , Alven Capital , and several business angels , allowing the Paris - based startup team to launch their checking account platform . A few months ago we also mentioned Qonto as one of " 10 French startups to look out for in 2017 " . Founded in 2016 , Qonto presents itself as the first fully online SME financing tool . Qonto provides an online banking service that allows entrepreneurs , startups and SMEs to create a bank account in less than 5 minutes . With Qonto you can instantly receive an IBAN and get started to manage your company 's physical and digital business cards and perform your day to day operations . According to the Qonto founders , the fresh capital will be used by the French startup to expedite the development of their online banking platform and offer its services to small businesses . The Qonto founders Alexandre Prot and Steve Anavi stated : " We are certainly not bankers , but we are serial entrepreneurs . Starting from a blank page , we have taken the technology and product standards of Google , Amazon customer service , and SaaS sector pricing . We have also surrounded us with the best partners for our banking back - office . Our agnostic approach was a huge bet , but the feedback we 've had from our 200 users in beta is without appeal and promising for the future . We are honored by the trust of our users , of the 30 talented people who have joined our team , and our investors "
With $ 1.5 million raised in venture funding , led by 01 Ventures , Bibblio 's new content recommendation engine is dedicated to helping quality publishers and content businesses ensure their users find exactly what they need when they need it . The London - based startup was founded in 2014 and raised $ 300,000 in its initial seed round from business angels in March 2015 . According to the Bibblio founders , the combination of enormous quantities of content and poor discovery is a serious obstacle to a connected digital world of knowledge , providing everyone with exactly what they need at their fingertips . Trying to find what you 're looking for can be hard sometimes . In order to solve that problem , Bibblio created a plug - n - play , ad - free content recommendation toolkit powered by machine learning to recirculate the best content from a provider 's own catalog . Entertainment businesses already understand that good discovery can make the difference between a one - time visitor and a loyal user or subscriber . Market leaders like Spotify , Netflix and YouTube can now generate up to 80% of their engagement time from recommendations . But most businesses do n't have years and millions of dollars to build a system like this . Bibblio wants to level the playing field for publishers of all shapes and sizes . The statup provides partners with a smart content recommendation toolkit powered by machine learning algorithms that finds the most relevant content for users . Ad - free content is recirculated from a publisher 's own catalog to get the best content to their users exactly when they need it . And it can be deployed in hours , not months . Bibblio founder and CEO Mads Holmen stated : " This marks a break with first generation ' content recommendation ' companies like Taboola and Outbrain , which focussed on pushing adverts and clickbait ' sponsored content ' rather than giving users what they really wanted . This was never a solution for high quality content creators , whose brands are damaged by proximity to dubious stories and ' fake news ' . Bibblio will help them realize the value of their content and deepen their relationships with their user base . " Bibblio has just launched a new version of its algorithm for its recommendation toolkit with partners such as Canadian Electronic Library and The Day . Bob Gibson , Owner of Canadian Electronic Library stated : " We chose Bibblio 's recommendation toolkit as an easy and efficient way to provide suggested books and articles with minimal development overhead at our end . So far it has delivered beyond our expectations and we look forward to widening the scope of content recommendations across desLibris . "

Perdoo is a fast - growing goal management platform that helps companies realize their goals . The Berlin - based startup was founded in 2014 by Henrik - Jan van der Pol and Jonathan Morrice . Their platform is available in English , Dutch , German and Spanish , and thousands of employees in about 260 companies across the world are already using Perdoo . The next step for the young company is the US expansion . Earlier this week we talked to Perdoo 's Co - Founder and CEO Henrik - Jan van der Pol to learn more about the current state of the goal management platform and plans for the future . How did you and your co - founder Jonathan Morrice come up with the idea for Perdoo and how did it all start ? During my work as a management consultant , I came across many companies that suffer from the same problems : poor strategy execution , a lack of transparency , and disengaged employees . As a result , people are not rowing in the same direction and companies are lagging far behind their actual potential . At some point , I heard about the goal management framework OKR ( Objectives & Key Results ) through Google and found that it 's exactly what the modern workplace needs . I was excited about the idea of enabling every organization to set their goals like Google . When I met my co - founder Jonny at a startup event , it turned out that he was already working on a similar idea . In late 2014 , we launched a simple landing page announcing that we 're planning to build an OKR tool . After one month , we already generated 50 signups without any marketing . Encouraged by the demand , we started hosting meetups in Berlin , London , and Amsterdam . With that input , I created a SlideShare presentation on OKR that brought us lots of signups and now has over 350,000 views . That was enough motivation for us to actually get started building the goal management tool . What were the main stumbling blocks in the first year after founding Perdoo and how did you overcome them ? Finding the right people , both investors and employees , was the biggest challenge for us . We had to make sure we 're all aligned on how we want to build this company and attract talented team members who are eager to join a super early stage startup . We bootstrapped our company because OKR was still a really young market and it forced us to focus on the essentials . Despite having a healthy cashflow very soon , it was difficult for us to attract investors , again because enterprise goal management was such a young market . Getting MAKERS on board was a game changer for us . The Berlin - based ( pre- ) seed investor not only helped us with cash but also with manpower . Most importantly , they boosted our own confidence that we were on an interesting track . How would you explain Perdoo and its unique value proposition to someone who never heard of it before ? What we do is really simple : we help organizations and teams to set , track , and achieve their goals . Goals are a crucial part of any business , as they reflect your ambitions and define what success means to you . Through our platform , everybody is able to focus on what matters most right now , and see how their work fits into the bigger picture . That 's essentially what strategy execution is all about . Your software is based on the OKR framework . What 's behind all this ? OKR stands for Objectives and Key Results and is a goal management framework that originated at Intel and was later popularized by Google . Its main purpose is to connect measurable company and team objectives , make them transparent , and allow employees to move together in the right direction with full focus . Inspired by Google 's success with the framework , OKR spread out across Silicon Valley companies such as LinkedIn , Twitter , and Zynga . Nowadays companies of all types across the world use OKR . You just released a new version of Perdoo . How does this new version differ from the old one ? The old version of Perdoo was already popular for its simple and intuitive interface , and a sharp focus on OKR . We wanted to maintain that course , putting everything in a technically improved infrastructure with a great - looking design . The new platform is much better setup to integrate with your day - to - day work . Employees can now add initiatives to their goals , creating a strong link between strategy and execution . Besides that , we 've put a lot of effort into creating a more guiding environment so every user can become an OKR pro in no time . For instance , the new version has a step - by - step OKR creation wizard that even tells you if you 're setting a good goal while you create it . What are the next milestones for Perdoo and how is the market developing ? Now that we 've laid the groundwork with the new version of Perdoo , we want to integrate our goal management platform with any business software stack you can imagine , covering all common tracking , analytics , and productivity tools . On the business side , we want to gain a foothold in the U.S. market . Germany 's economics ministry BMWi recently selected us for the German Accelerator mentoring program in Silicon Valley to support our expansion with their know - how and network . Looking at the development of the strategic workforce management market , we 're confident that there 's still a massive potential for us to grow . According to IDC , it 's a $ 5.7B market that will have an average annual growth rate of 12% until 2020 . There are already a few other software vendors that integrate OKR management in HR solutions . Instead of focusing on employee performance evaluation and feedback , we 're putting the company 's success and how everyone contributes to it first . What 's your vision for the future of work and what 's Perdoo 's contribution ? Companies will have to realize that innovation ca n't be in the hands of leaders only . It needs to become a firm part of the company culture , encouraging each and every employee to find new , creative ways to solve problems . People are a crucial resource for companies and probably the one with the most potential currently being wasted . Purpose will become one of the most important currencies on the job market and a key success factor for organizations . Feeling like the own work is part of something bigger and has an impact already is more important than salary for many young workers . A sense of purpose at work drastically boosts productivity and can make the difference between winners and losers on the market . With Perdoo we help companies create transparency and a sense of purpose and achievement among their workforce . You 're originally from the Netherlands . What is your experience with Berlin as a location to start a tech company and why did n't you choose Amsterdam ? Two years ago , when we started Perdoo , the startup scene in Amsterdam was still quite young . At that time , Berlin definitely had a whole lot more to offer : cheap office space , low cost of living , an interesting job market , a huge network of investors and fellow founders , and simply an amazing city with a unique vibe . Basically all the ingredients that you need to get a startup off the ground .
KRY , the Swedish digital health startup that aims to make healthcare more accessible and convenient through on - demand video consultations , today announces a EUR20 million Series A funding round led by global venture capital firm Accel with participation from existing investors Index Ventures , Creandum , and Project A. KRY will use the funding to deepen penetration in current markets , launch in new markets , and reach its goal of providing sustainable healthcare with equal access for everyone in Europe . As part of the investment , Sonali de Rycker , who led Accel 's investments in Spotify and Avito , will join KRY 's board . Founded in 2014 , KRY reduces pressure on highly strained healthcare systems , by offering a more accessible and convenient digital consultation service . KRY estimates that with existing technology , 90% of all primary care visits can be transferred online in future , with the service currently capable of handling 60% of the 100 most common diagnoses in primary healthcare . By using KRY , patients who do not need a physical examination can see a doctor faster , while time at a physical clinic is freed up for those who are most in need of in - person care . Johannes Schildt , KRY CEO and co - founder , commented : " Our main priority is always to build a service that allows patients equal access to healthcare on their own terms . We welcome Accel who share a great ambition for healthcare to be revolutionised across Europe . " Sonali de Rycker , Partner at Accel , added : " KRY brings tremendous efficiencies and cost savings to the healthcare system while providing much needed access to timely healthcare for consumers . We are thrilled to back Johannes and the KRY team , who have already achieved impressive growth in Sweden , Norway and Spain in a short period of time . " Stockholm - based KRY is Sweden 's first ever digital medical centre , allowing patients to have a video consultation with a KRY - employed healthcare professional via their mobile phone or tablet , rather than a physical appointment . KRY , which launched in 2015 , serves more than 1% of all primary healthcare in Sweden , employing over 200 doctors . KRY is also available in Norway and Spain and in total already counts more than 100,000 users . Patients can download the KRY app - available on iOS and Android - and select a suitable time for a video - based doctor 's appointment . Prior to the appointment , the patient describes their symptoms in writing , uploads relevant pictures , and responds to symptom - specific questions . At the scheduled time , the doctor calls the patient through the app to start the video consultation . During the video call , patients may receive prescriptions for medication , advice , referral to a specialist , or lab or home tests with a follow - up appointment . Prescribed medication and home tests can then be delivered straight to the patient 's home within two hours . KRY 's video conferences cost 250 Swedish Krona ( around PS25/$31 ) per session . In August 2016 KRY raised EUR6.1 million seed funding , which helped the company launch in Norway and Spain and secure key hires .
Founded in 2013 , Funderbeam is the world 's first primary and secondary market for early - stage investments secured by the blockchain and with free data intelligence on + 180k startups and investors . The vision of the Tallinn - based company is to make it easy to invest and trade in growth companies so that great teams and investors everywhere can create a world where good ideas always win . Funderbeam is an Estonian startup success story led by the charismatic female entrepreneur Kaidi Ruusalepp . Last year , we already mentioned Kaidi as one of Europe 's most influential women in the startup and venture capital space . A few days ago , we had the opportunity to do an interview with her . Here it is : How did you and your co - founder Urmas Peiker come up with the idea for Funderbeam and how did it all start ? It 's a typical startup story that starts with one idea but evolves into something even bigger : ) We started to build a trading game for teenagers and discussed if they could virtually list startups . But after some market analysis and some screenshots it was clear that it will be a real stock market . We both come from the industry and know the problems , so it was actually easy to start building new " stock exchange " from the scratch . For now it 's just not about funding and trading startups , but also to provide capital for SME 's . What were the main stumbling blocks in the first 2 years after founding Funderbeam and how did you overcome them ? The main thing for Funderbeam has always been to build the ecosystem of funding global growth companies with liquidity . It 's much bigger vision than just building an online store or app for cleaners , and much longer journey than most of the ( VC ) investors can take . So it was about convincing audience about us being able to run and win the marathon ( after 100 m distance is completed ) . The other is motivating people internally . It 's always easier to build short victories , but in our case to build funding & trading platform takes " ages " and meanwhile you have nothing to show . Seems that we 've been lucky - both team and investors are strong : ) What is Funderbeam 's unique value proposition that sets it apart from its competitors ? How is it different from equity crowdfunding platforms like Seedrs or platforms like AngeList ? Funderbeam is a combination of three things : Data , Investing and Trading . We believe that these three pillars are all equally essential to achieve our vision : A world where you do n't need to be in Silicon Valley to be part of a great ecosystem for nurturing and maturing companies . 1 ) We provide data , as it 's essential for both founders and investors in order to make informed fundraising and investment decisions . 2 ) We provide all the tools needed to run a fundraising campaign , either as a private syndicate or with an added element of raising funds from your community 3 ) We make all the investments tradable , providing instant liquidity to investments like you know it from a stock market . So far , we have no direct competitors , as other companies only provide one or two of these pillars . And we 're the only one by now who has investors from all around the globe , from 93 countries ( major crowdfunding platforms who are testing secondary market are mainly local or regional ) . We 're also the first one who built it on the blockchain technology and by now having top know - how inhouse . What would you say are the main advantages of equity crowdfunding versus raising funding from traditional venture capital firms ? We do n't believe that one is better than the other ; we actually do n't believe that it 's even one or the other . One of our goals is to make take professional and institutional investors make their investments and open their deals to retail investors to harness the power of the crowd . That said , we actually do n't consider ourselves a crowdfunding platform , but more like a community tool . It takes a whole ecosystem to run a successful company - founders , early investors , supporters , later stage investors , exit possibility etc . So the power is in combination , not in competition . Funderbeam has raised our own round on our own platform and what surprised us is the willingness of the crowd investors to work for Funderbeam . I mean work like an ambassadors - opening up new markets , spread the word , build local language websites etc . This is something you never get from VC 's . But as said earlier - the best solution is the combination of different participants . Would you say it 's easier to secure equity crowdfunding compared to raising funding from VCs ? And if so : Do you see a risk of lower quality startups securing crowdfunding and as a consequence creating a high failure rate ? There are definitely companies who see crowdfunding as a " last resort " if they are having trouble raising money from VCs . However , we do n't consider ourselves a crowdfunding platform , and we are very critical of what companies are able to go on the platform . As all the companies who fundraise , will be trading as well , we are very cautious about the quality . It does n't make sense to get more companies fundraising and then only few of them trading 3 years later . We get 100 applications from startups all around the world and we finally work only with 3 - 4 of them . One of our requirements is , that the startup has a lead investor , who will negotiate the deal , invest a significant amount of the total funds raising , and be the face of the syndicate . By doing this , we are ensuring that we only get companies who can raise from angels / institutional investors and actively chose to open the round to more people in order to gain the benefits mentioned above . Funderbeam is a global startup stock exchange built on blockchain technology . How does that exactly work and what is possible due to blockchain technology which otherwise would have been impossible for Funderbeam to offer ? Funderbeam uses blockchain to secure investing , trading , keeping track of investors ( cap table management ) and clearing the trades . So the blockchain carries many roles that in traditional stock markets are provided by many intermediaries . It is the trust that intermediaries should represent and the trust is now built - in technology - blockchain . Funderbeam uses Bitcoin blockchain , utilising a technology called coloured coins . Coloured Coins are pieces of Bitcoin , where metadata is embedded on top of that and is recorded in the blockchain . We call them tokens . Each token represents real world assets . So we disintermediate the whole system and make it much transparent and effective , without loosing the trust . Funderbeam does not use cryptocurrency yet , but it 's on the ideas loop . So we only secure trades & ownership on the blockchain . With a team of about 30 employees , how do you support corporate culture and how do you make sure your team stays happy and motivated ? It all starts by carefully selecting whom you let in . We have very different personalities , nationalities , cultures etc , but the whole team shares the same values . So it 's like you work with your friends . This does most of the job : ) Once you 're in , the team generates million of ideas how to have the working environment fun and productive and motivating . Last weekend most of the team attended " tough guy run " . It 's about running a distance with all kind of crazy exercise on it - running through mud , climbing over the walls , swimming over the lake etc . I 've attached a photo of our CMO and HR manager on the distance - this is the best photo to describe how Funderteam works . Options , team camps etc are on top of that , but as mentioned - it all starts at the gate : same values and colourful personalities . What is your experience with Tallinn as a location to start a tech company ? Tallinn provides a unique combination of factors that make it an extremely good place to start a tech company . Tech talent . For historic reasons , there is a high concentration of really talented engineers . This goes back to the Soviet times , where a large part of the engineering power was placed in Estonia . More recently , the success of companies like Skype have created a culture where everyone believes that the internet has made it possible even for small countries to built big things . Estonia is a startup . Estonia can in many ways resemble a startup when compared to big countries . It 's small , has a flat hierarchy , fewer legacy systems to maintain ( Estonia went straight to digital governance ) , and is in constant growth mode ( GDP above EU average in 7 of last 10 years ) . Direct contact with regulators . Being small , Estonian policy makers are easier to get in touch with and can act on ideas faster . A great example of this is the startup visa , that was suggested by the community and now allows us to hire talent from outside the EU and quickly bring them to Estonia . For us in particular , working closely with the regulator is paramount to our business , as we are exploring how we can develop legislation in order to embrace the future while protecting investors and staying within EU - legislation . Hassle - free administration of companies . Everything is online , starting with establishing a company less than 20 minutes .
Since launching in December 2016 , the Danish startup RFRSH Entertainment has established itself as a major player in the esports scene through commercial management and performance optimization for 3 of the world 's strongest CS : GO ( Counter - Strike ) teams : Astralis , Heroic and GODSENT . Simultaneously , RFRSH has worked on developing a range of new concepts including a unique series of media content and live events to be announced later this year . Backed by Creandum , the founders of Supercell , and investors Tommy Ahlers and David Helgason , RFRSH Entertainment has now strengthened the company 's financial foundation through a capital injection of EUR7.2 million . Regarding the next steps RFRSH Founder and CEO Nikolaj Nyholm stated : " We 're underway with a number of new concepts to be introduced over the last half of 2017 . This will include the launch of a range of new unique content and media packages , game changing live events and a further strengthening of the organization around the CS : GO teams benefitting the teams , fans and the partners . " The capital injection secures a continuous very strong position and gives RFRSH the possibility to both strengthen the organization , support of the teams affiliated with the company and invest in new , original media and live entertainment products . With an estimated 350 million fans worldwide , esports already attracts significant viewerships and mass audience exposure . Estimates show the number or viewers growing year of year . Simon Schmincke from the VC firm Creandum commented : " We have no doubt that the RFRSH organization is in the perfect position to take esports live entertainment a step up , and we are confident that the platforms being developed by the team will become a major channel for endemic as well as non - endemic brands to reach a new and younger audience , who is no longer active via traditional media channels . We believe this is the chance to elevate esports content on the next level . "
Hometree , a startup that intends to revolutionise the way that homeowners buy a new boiler , has raised EUR2.1 million in funding from LocalGlobe , DN Capital , Oxford Capital and FJ Labs . The list of previous investors includes prominent business angels and a number of directors from President Al Gore 's London - based investment firm , who have invested personally . Founded in 2016 and based in London , Hometree is launching in the boiler installation market initially , but intends to build a next generation energy company that can provide a whole range of energy efficient services and products to homeowners , allowing them to take control of their energy consumption . As energy in the home becomes more complex with the introduction of smart meters , connected devices , battery storage and solar , the consumer needs a partner they can trust . The startup chose the boiler market as a logical starting point , since buying a boiler is one of the most expensive and difficult home repairs that people face . New boiler installations is largely an offline market with poor price transparency and requiring multiple visits to the home and with little assurance of quality . The UK market alone is worth more than PS4 billion a year , yet the biggest player ( British Gas ) has less than 10% of installations , with 80% plus of new boiler installations still carried out by independent tradespeople where it can be tough to find a trusted installer . Using registered and vetted installers across the South East of the UK , Hometree wants to bring the ease of e - commerce - speed , price transparency , endorsement from customers - to this traditional trade . The hybrid online / offline business contracts directly with consumers , offering them a painless way to get a boiler installed , in what is a mostly offline market . Key to Hometree 's offering is a range of industry firsts for the heating industry : Hometree will offer a choice of boilers from leading brands , 10 year guarantees , finance options through Shawbrook Bank , annual servicing and a range of smart thermostats such as Hive and Nest . The average price of new boiler installations on Hometree is PS2,250 , below the industry average price of PS2,300 * and on average 25% cheaper than British Gas . Once Hometree has established itself as a force in boilers , it plans to build a full home services installation business , capable of challenging the big six energy companies in providing services to the connected home in a way that puts the consumer in control . Simon Phelan , Co - Founder and CEO , said : " Installing a boiler remains a painful and mostly offline experience for homeowners . Much like Eve and Purplebricks have upended their sleepy and over - priced industries of mattresses and estate agency , we intend to disrupt the heating industry with best practices from e - commerce , fair and transparent prices and a great brand . We will use this strong foundation as a springboard into the broader home energy space , re - thinking how energy companies interact with consumers from the ground up . " George Henry , partner at Local Globe , said : " Across Europe the relationship between energy companies and homeowners is shifting . Hometree is taking a radical new approach to providing services to the home and building a 21st century utility . The best companies often start from a very specific pain point . Boiler installation is just the first step on the way for a company that will challenge the incumbents to win the customer relationship and is entirely rethinking the way that houses improve their heating systems . " In the long - term , Hometree 's founders ' aim is to play a leading role in reinventing the home energy model for the 21st century - helping homeowners reduce their energy consumption , while providing safe and reliable products and services quickly and easily . The business is building on current trends in the energy sector : lack of trust in the big six energy providers , the connected home , distributed generation and the desire for renewable energy and sustainable products . As an indicator of how these disruptive trends are becoming more commercially attractive , Hometree is one of the first energy companies in Europe to raise primarily tech focused venture capital . Co - Founders Simon Phelan and Andreu Tobella have experience working in private equity and climate change projects around the world and across the British Isles . Both are passionate about the need for British homes to become more sustainable when they replace or upgrade heating systems and have identified many points where the energy retailing sector can become more efficient , using online tools .
As Europe 's first B2B focused startup accelerator , Startup Wise Guys was founded in 2012 and can easily be described as a pioneer in the accelerator business . The Tallinn- and Riga - based investment firm offers an excellent 3 + 1 month acceleration program coupled with seed investment of EUR20 K , great mentors and a well established business network . With already more than 50 accelerated companies , Startup Wise Guys is becoming the largest investor in B2B companies in the Baltics and the entire CEE region . Application are now open for the next batch in September and we thought this might be a good opportunity to talk to Cristobal Alonso , the ultimate " make it happen " person at SWG . Applications are now open for the next September batch in Riga . What are your expectations ? We are actively recruiting till July 9 and already getting some pretty awesome startups from all over the CEE . Batch 8 that just graduated has set the benchmark high - 9 nationalities within 11 teams , almost half already mature entrepreneurs with launched products and even experience at some other accelerators . We hope to keep it up the same way with Batch 9 in Riga . Definitely want at least the same level of diversity - so international crowd , female founders , various age and business experience combinations . We have done some program adjustments during last batch in Tallinn , so I think the startups will benefit from our added elements such as dedicated marketing , tech weeks , as well as " hacker in residence " - a technical advisor working more closer with the tech teams of each startup . How is the program structured at SWG and what makes SWG stand out from the other accelerators ? A typical SWG program runs for 3 months and is based on intense mentoring . First month is all about business model , legal setup , accountancy , then we smoothly move into sales , customer discovery , marketing , last month is less active in mentoring and more focused on preparing the startups for fundraising while continue pushing sales . Right now we are also working hard on an option for supporting startups additional 3 months with office space and mentoring to get them ready for pre - seed round . We are a boutique accelerator , which also means flexibility and ability to adapt to the needs of our startups . 11 teams is a maximum we can take in one batch to provide a quality program . So we will grow in terms of more locations , but we have no plans to grow the number of teams , as then you lose the personal touch and possibility to tailor the program . As one of our Ukrainian teams from last batch said - it was amazing to see that SWG functions as a startup themselves , gathering feedback , making real changes and showing that you can always improve , when listening to your customers . But what truly makes us stand out is the business focus and family ! For example , although we do regular and intensive pitch training , it is only a result of all the " back - stage " work with business model , product , customer discovery etc . We are trying hard to make the perfect business , not the perfect pitch . The other thing is that startups that become part of the family , stay and stick around for years . We support them long after the program has finished and starting with this year are also providing lots of additional opportunities after graduation , such as CEE All Stars fundraising event , CEO Alumni getaway , visits to top tech events and some partnering investors . And we see the benefit of that , not only the community of more than 70 graduates are using each others help , but some of them even return to us as angel investors in our newest batches . SWG is successfully accelerating and investing in the CEE region for more than 5 years now . What is your favorite moment so far ? For us as an accelerator , the biggest thing was our first exit - company VitalFields from our very first batch was acquired last year in December . Also having the first expansion and successful program in Riga , as well as - first ever in Europe equity crowdfunding for an accelerator bringing on board with us more than 100 investors , some of them actually being our own alumni . But looking broader , it is great to see CEE startup ecosystem bonding and understanding that for small markets to make it big , you need to collaborate . One such highlight was CEE All Stars event in Warsaw hosted by Google Campus and co - organized by us and other biggest hubs and accelerators - top CEE startups raising seed rounds met with regional and international investors . Hope it will become an annual event . SWG is quite international , including startups beyond the CEE region . How do you reach out to potential applicants beyond the local ecosystem ? We try to have very little local startups in a batch . Our internal joke goes that Estonians accelerate way better in Riga , Latvia ( our currently second home ) and vice - versa - Latvians in Tallinn , Estonia . We are also very active on pre - accelerator activities which we have organized together with corporates like Telia in Estonia or Denmark and also judging in many startup battles in the region . To get the most of CEE and beyond , we do very active scouting and roadshows . Just as an example I travel more than 150 times a year to reach out to communities , conferences and so forth . This year for Batch 9 we are visiting more than 24 locations , providing mentoring help , early stage funding workshops and organizing pitch battles . Local partners like Civitta , Microsoft , startup hubs and co - working spaces and investors in each of the countries we visit and build relationships make a huge difference , as they are the ones , who can do direct outreach to local startups . Apart from that , we of course do some social media marketing and PR , but our best channel is our " family " - alumni , mentors , investors , partners . More than 80% of intros and recommendations come from our extended network , and usually that brings us also very good quality startups , making the final selection process quite challenging . Beyond the formal requirements , what is that SWG looks for in a startup ? Team , product , market - those are the three things we look at , along with initial traction with pilot , paid customer that proves that there is a real need for the product . However , it is always about the people . So ambition , international mentality and coachability play equally important role . I 've actually just posted a blog post on our webpage about , why it matters so much and why we pay such an attention to personalities and group setup . Coming from a vivid startup ecosystem , what is the most interesting thing in the baltic startup ecosystem at the moment ? Oh man , Baltics are booming in so many ways right now ! Estonia with its hassle free e - residency and well developed ecosystem is at the forefront , but both neighbours Latvia and Lithuania are catching up with various support tools , startup visa and awesome hubs . Also the tech events in the region like TechChill , Latitude59 and others are providing great value both for startups , but also investors . To me as an expat in these countries , it has always been striking , how globally they think . And it 's natural , because - what can you do with a 2 or 3 million people market , if you do n't think globally ? In a way - it also runs in SWG blood - we are not the biggest accelerator , but we think big and want our startups to do the same . Many of our international startups have said they 've been amazed about the friendliness , openness and support level from the ecosystem in the Baltics , as well as availability of quality mentors ( take Estonia , where you can get guys from Transferwise , Taxify , Pipedrive mentoring , or Riga with info.gram or their Fintech startups like Twino and Mintos ) . Overall , I 'd say that it is the perfect place to be for early stage startups from CEE , before conquering the world , as the living and business costs are relatively low , the mentality is right and especially Riga has good flight connections , making it an easy access for international mentors and investors . And while the ecosystem is lively there 's no too much noise so startups can focus on what matters - product / market fit and building sales traction fast . Your partnership with Lattelecom is a good example of how corporations can help the startup ecosystem grow . How would you describe this relationship and what recommendations would you give to other corporations thinking about this issue ? We have had several collaborations with corporates , and would name VUNK pre - acceleration program with Telia as a good example on synergy between corporation and accelerator . The same goes for JUMP program in Denmark . With Lattelecom we collaborated only for 1 program in Riga and now have gone our separate ways . It is important to realize that startups and corporates are very different animals , they operate at different speeds and have very different governance mechanisms . For example , their tolerance for failure is so radically different that it can bring along lots of frustration . I think the most important factor is for the corporate to have a clear objective / expectation on what they want out of a collaboration with an accelerator or startup initiative . It can be talent attraction , culture change , service portfolio diversification , brand awareness , etc . But you need to have clarity . I 've seen a lot of failures , where either of the sides , but usually more the Corporate one , has not been honest or has not clearly communicated what they expect . That 's a road to disaster ! Additionally - collaboration should be for a long - run , at least a 2 -3 years vision not just a short term one , and for it to work , top management needs to be " on board " , supporting and preferably also deeply involved . I guess the perfect corporation and startup / accelerator fit depends on each situation , and given a successful setup , both sides can benefit greatly . Corporations in attracting talent , seeing business development opportunities , and upgrading internal processes , by bringing innovation . Whereas for startups , especially in our speciality - B2B - corporations can be the perfect partner for pilot projects , tests and also synergy between industry experts and startup founders . As for startups , in your opinion , what makes a startup become the next big thing ? Well it is important to define what is the next big thing ... I do n't like the unicorn topic , so I 'd say we talk about a startup with a chance on a big exit within 5 - 7 years . There 's a mix of many factors , some of those objective like the right timing and a bit of luck , but on the other hand I think it 's a lot about subjective factors like : clear understanding on why you are different and compelling story on why to use your service , then a clear focus on customer validation and initial sales , a small but well balanced team that has what it takes to be successful ( ambition , perseverance , good sense of humour , values ) but at the same time can leverage enormously their network for advice , intros and global scale . As for SWG , what are the next steps ? While we still want to keep our boutique approach , the plans are quite ambitious - 200 companies accelerated by 2020 , at least 2 or 3 additional locations in CEE region , a campus in Western Europe and launch pad in US and Asia . As for programs - we plan to have partnership with strong corporates in the Nordics and CEE to launch several vertical accelerators and have also several ScaleUP programs for seed investments . Last but not least , we want to have sufficient funding to be able to do follow - up seed investments in at least 25% of our portfolio . And overall - have lots of fun and positive impact to ecosystems while doing so .

Diffblue , Europe 's leader in AI for code , just announced that it has raised $ 22 million in Series A funding , one year after its spin - out from the University of Oxford . The funding round of the Oxford - based startup is led by Goldman Sachs Principal Strategic Investments , alongside Oxford Sciences Innovations ( OSI ) and Oxford Technology and Innovations Fund ( OTIF ) . Diffblue 's core AI builds an exact mathematical model of any code base . This model allows a very deep semantic understanding of what a program is trying to do . The Diffblue team is launching three products that are built on the core engine : In the past coders have had to do these tasks manually , or rely on tools that check the syntax of a code base without understanding the semantic meaning . Diffblue 's suite of products aims to help coders write much better quality code , much more quickly ( coders typically use up to 30% of their time manually writing tests - so the cost savings are potentially enormous ) . The code - testing product , which will be fully integrated with continuous integration servers such as Jenkins and software repository providers such as GitHub , is now available for Java and C. Under development are the Python , JavaScript and C # versions of the testing product , as well as the security and refactoring product . Lilly Bussmann , Principal at Oxford Sciences Innovations ( OSI ) commented : " We 're proud to be supporting one of Europe 's most exciting tech startups . In a world that 's increasingly run by software , Diffblue 's mission of equipping developers and organisations with the next generation AI - powered dev tools is a very worthwhile one , both in terms of its economic and social impact . " Daniel Kroening , Professor of Computer Science at University of Oxford and founder of Diffblue , stated : " The products we are developing at Diffblue 's use AI to empower users to develop code of a far higher quality and security standard than would have been possible before . In doing so , it eases the burden of testing which is one of the biggest pain points for developers , and frees up their time to focus on what they do best . " The funding round Diffblue was able to close is one of Europe 's largest Series A rounds for an AI company . The UK - based startup achieved this within just one year since Diffblue 's inception .
